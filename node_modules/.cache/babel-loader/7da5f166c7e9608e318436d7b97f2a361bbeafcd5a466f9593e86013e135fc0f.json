Advertising messages about\r\n              your establishment will be distributed on social networks\r\n              (Facebook, Instagram) or in the form of messages via\r\n              instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p className=\"HowWorkBlock__content\">\r\n              The introduction of technology significantly increases the\r\n              number of reviews left on Google Maps, which subsequently\r\n              increases the popularity and frequency of issuance in\r\n              Google services.
